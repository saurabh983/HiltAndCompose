# HiltAndCompose Android Project

HiltAndCompose is an Android project that showcases the integration of Hilt for Dependency Injection, Flow for efficient data loading, Jetpack Compose for building the UI, and follows the MVVM-Clean Architecture pattern. The entire project is written in Kotlin, harnessing its expressive power and conciseness.

# Features

### Hilt Dependency Injection: 
Hilt simplifies dependency injection in Android apps, providing a standard way to incorporate Dagger functionality. It enables modularization and ensures the scalability of your application.
### Flow for Data Loading: 
Utilizing Kotlin's Flow API for reactive programming, data loading becomes more efficient and concise. This project demonstrates how to integrate Flow seamlessly into your architecture for handling asynchronous operations.
### Jetpack Compose for UI: 
The UI layer is built using Jetpack Compose, the modern Android UI toolkit that simplifies UI development with a declarative syntax. Compose allows for building intuitive and dynamic user interfaces, reducing boilerplate code.
### MVVM-Clean Architecture: 
The project adheres to the MVVM-Clean Architecture, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability. This architectural pattern ensures a clear distinction between business logic, presentation logic, and data, leading to a robust and scalable codebase.
# Tech Stack

### Kotlin: 
The entire project is written in Kotlin, a concise and expressive programming language for modern Android development.
### Hilt: 
Hilt is used for Dependency Injection, making the codebase modular, scalable, and easier to maintain.
### Flow: 
Kotlin's Flow API is employed for efficient and reactive data loading, enhancing the responsiveness of the application.
### Jetpack Compose: 
Compose is the UI toolkit used to create a modern and dynamic user interface, offering a declarative way to define UI components.
# Project Structure

The project structure is organized based on the MVVM-Clean Architecture, separating concerns into distinct modules:

### app: 
Contains the main application code, UI components, and is responsible for coordinating the interaction between the presentation and domain layers.
### repository: 
Manages data-related operations, including repositories and data sources.
### di: 
Houses the business logic and use cases, representing the core functionality of the application.
### ui: 
Handles the presentation logic, including ViewModels and UI-related components.
